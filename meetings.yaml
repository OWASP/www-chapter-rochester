        In this short presentation, we'll cover the basics of cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities: how they work, how to fix or mitigate them, and where you can learn more. We'll examine stored, reflected and DOM based attacks on a live vulnerable web application.

        (Note: This is the same presentation that was part of Rochester 2600's "The ABC's of Infosec".)
